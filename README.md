Model Reference: U-Net
This project utilizes the U-Net model, a well-established convolutional neural network architecture commonly used for biomedical image segmentation. 
The U-Net model was originally proposed by Olaf Ronneberger et al. in their paper titled "U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation", presented at the Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) conference in 2015.
